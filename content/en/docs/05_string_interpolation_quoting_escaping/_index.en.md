title: "5. String Interpolation and Escaping"
weight: 5

Using the Jenkins Pipelines we quite often need to somehow insert values from variables, parameters,
env variables and so on into a string or a parameter of a function.

Starting with Jenkins Pipelines and the string interpolation rules that are identical to those of [Groovy](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/#all-strings), might be
a bit confusing to many newcomers.

In this lab we are going to cover the following:

* Declaring and using strings
* String interpolation
* Escaping
* Accessing variables, env variables, build and pipeline parameters


## How to declare a String

In groovy there are basically four ways on how to declare strings:

```groovy
def singleQuoted = 'Jenkins'
def doubleQuoted = "Pipeline"
def trippleSingleQuoted = '''Techlab'''
def trippleDoubleQuoted = """Techlab"""
```

Only the double quoted strings support string interpolation

```groovy
def company = 'puzzle'
echo 'join the ${company}'
echo "join the ${company}"
echo '''join the ${company}'''
echo """join the ${company}"""
```

Will result in:

```
join the ${company}
join the puzzle
join the ${company}
join the puzzle
```

The tripple quoted (both single and double) string can be multiline

```groovy
def trippleQuoted = '''Jenkins
Pipeline
Techlab'''
echo trippleQuoted
```

or

```groovy
def trippleQuoted = """Jenkins
Pipeline
Techlab"""
echo trippleQuoted
```

Will result in:

```
Jenkins
Pipeline
Techlab
```


## Escaping

Escaping a quote in a string

```groovy
def singleQuoted = 'this is a single quote: \' '
def doubleQuoted = "this is a double quote: \" "
```

| Escape sequence | Character |
|---|---|
| \t   | tabulation  |
| \b   | backspace  |
| \n   | newline  |
| \r   | carriage return  |
| \f   | form feed  |
| \\\  | backslash  |
| \\'  | single quote (for single quoted and triple single quoted strings) |
| \\"  | double quote (for double quoted and triple double quoted strings) |


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Get used to the string interpolation and escaping

Use the following example pipeline to play with the string definitions you learned so far

> **Note** since we use the declarative pipeline syntax to execute groovy code we use the ``script{...}`` section.
> With the script block we are able to declare variables.

Create a new branch named ``lab-5.1`` from branch ``lab-2.1`` and change the contents of the ``Jenkinsfile`` to:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def company = 'puzzle'
                    echo 'join the ${company}'
                    echo "join the ${company}"
                    echo '''join the ${company}'''
                    echo """join the ${company}"""

                    echo "tabulation>\t<"
                    echo "backspace>\b<"
                    echo "newline>\n<"
                    echo "carriage return>\r<"
                    echo "form feed>\f<"
                    echo "backslash>\\<"
                    echo "single quote>\'<"
                    echo "double quote>\"<"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```


### Check build log output

Go to the newly created pipeline for the new branch on Jenkins main.

Check the build log (Console Output) of the first run of this pipeline.
Does the output meet your expectations?


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2: Using Environment Variables or Parameters within a string in a Pipeline

All Environment Variables are available under ``${env.}``

Create a new branch named ``lab-5.2`` from branch ``lab-2.1`` and change the contents of the ``Jenkinsfile`` to:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        string(name: 'company_parameter', defaultValue: 'puzzle', description: 'The company the pipeline runs in')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo "Running ${env.BUILD_ID} on ${env.JENKINS_URL} in company ${params.company_parameter}"
            }
        }
    }
}
```


### Check build log for parameters

Go to the newly created pipeline for the new branch on Jenkins main.

Check the build log (Console Output) of the first run of this pipeline.
Are the variables replaced by parameter and environment variables?


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.3: Using values as params in a sh command


Working with pipelines we often want to pass a value of a variable into a ``sh`` - command.

For example:

```groovy
def company = 'puzzle'
sh "echo ${company}"
```

Will result in:

```
puzzle
```

Passing only the variable is pretty straight forward. Since we learned the string interpolation only works
for **double quoted** strings, the following

```groovy
def company = 'puzzle'
sh 'echo ${company}'
```

Will result in:

```
${company}
```

which is in this case not what we wanted.

It gets more complicated once you want to pass for example a double quote ``"`` to the shell command. Then the inner quotes must be escaped

```groovy
def company = 'puzzle'
sh "echo \"join the puzzle ${company}\""
```

Here a complete example.

Create a new branch named ``lab-5.3`` from branch ``lab-2.1`` and change the contents of the ``Jenkinsfile`` to:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        string(name: 'company_parameter', defaultValue: 'puzzle', description: 'The company the pipeline runs in')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh "echo \"Running ${env.BUILD_ID} on ${env.JENKINS_URL} in company ${params.company_parameter}\""
            }
        }
    }
}
```


### Check build log

Go to the newly created pipeline for the new branch on Jenkins main.

Check the build log (Console Output) of the first run of this pipeline.
Has the echo shell command run without errors?
