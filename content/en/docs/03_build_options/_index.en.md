When using multibranch pipelines, you can no longer configure build options (declarative syntax)
or build properties (scripted syntax) through the web interface. For single branch ``Jenkinsfile``
pipelines configuring build options/properties in the ``Jenkinsfile`` is recommended as well in
order to obtain a [single source of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth).
This lab shows how this is done.


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Build Options

In declarative pipelines build options/properties are configured through the ``options`` directive.
Only a single ``options`` directive is allowed and must be contained in the ``pipeline`` block.

Create a new branch named ``lab-3.1`` from branch ``lab-2.1`` and add the options block to the ``Jenkinsfile``.

```
{{< highlight groovy "hl_lines=3-8" >}}
pipeline {
    agent any
    options {
        buildDiscarder(logRotator(numToKeepStr: '5'))
        timeout(time: 10, unit: 'MINUTES')
        timestamps()  // Timestamper Plugin
        disableConcurrentBuilds()
    }
    stages {
        stage('Greeting') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello, World!'
            }
        }
    }
}
{{< / highlight >}}
```

This pipeline is configured to:

* Keep a maximum of **5** builds
* Timeout builds that run longer than **10 minutes**
* Print timestamps before each build log line
  * Uses the Timestamper Jenkins Plugin <https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Timestamper>
* Disallow concurrent executions of the Pipeline. Can be useful for preventing multiple simultaneously builds for one branch. However locks and milestones are the preferred solution for this because they allow newer builds to supersede older ones. This is especially important for longer builds and builds requesting user input. Also see [Lab 13](../13_stages_locks_milestones/).


### Check pipeline creation

Go to the [multibranch pipeline](http://localhost:8080/job/techlab/) of your Jenkins and see, if the pipeline for the new branch is created.

When the job `lab-3.1` is missing, you can click on `Scan Multibranch Pipeline Now` to start the discovery of new branches.

View the configuration to check, if the settings of the Jenkinsfile are configured.

> **Note:** The timeout option isn't shown in the configuration on the Jenkins main
